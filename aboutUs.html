    <p>Welcome to Akiba Savings, where we aim to provide users with a user-friendly interface to monitor and manage their finances effectively. Our mission is to empower individuals to make informed financial decisions and achieve their financial goals.</p>

    <p>Akiba Savings was founded with the goal of addressing the challenge of pooling all savings into a single account.

        <li>Allow users to set a target amount and optionally, allocate funds towards each goal.</li>
        <li>Allow users to view a list of their recent transactions.</li>
        <li>Enable users to categorize transactions (e.g., income, expenses) and add notes if necessary.</li>
    </ul>
